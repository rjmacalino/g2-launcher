// Page geometry, and the one way to change what the content area says.

// Every page is the same two containers: a status bar across the top and one
// content container filling the rest. The menu's content is a list, a tool's
// content is text, but the geometry and the IDs never change.
//
// The IDs being invariant is the point, not a convenience. We still do not know
// whether textContainerUpgrade matches on containerID alone or on ID and name
// together (#14). If it is ID alone, a clock tick aimed at the bar could land on
// tool content. Giving the bar ID 1 on every page and content ID 2 on every page
// makes that impossible either way, so the open question stops mattering here
// instead of being something to be careful about.
